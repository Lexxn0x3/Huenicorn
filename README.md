# Huenicorn

A free ambilight driver for your Philips Hueâ„¢ devices

## Description

Huenicorn is a free ambilight driver for Gnu/Linux.
In other words, Huenicorn allows you to extend the colorful atmosphere of your computer screen to your Hue light bulbs in real-time.
Huenicorn provides a simple web interface to assign specific portions of screen to the light bulbs you desire and save the settings for a further entertainment session.

## Project status

Huenicorn 1.0.1 is now ready and available.

This revision brings

* Fix for an important reliability bug on release mode for some compilers
* Add config parameter to bind REST backend to given IP
* Better documentation (with available Doxygen generation routine in CMake)
* Small UI changes

## Getting Started

* Before using Huenicorn, you need to define some entertainment area on your Hue bridge through the official application provided by Philips.

### Requirements

* Gnu/Linux system running X11 graphics session
* Philips Hue bridge with registered lamps

### Dependencies

* X11
* [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
* [CurlPP](https://github.com/jpbarrette/curlpp)
* [Restbed](https://github.com/Corvusoft/restbed)
* [Mbed-TLS](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls)
* [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)

### Compiling Huenicorn

Make sure the abovementionned are installed (preferably through your system's package manager)

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/openjowelsofts/huenicorn.git
cd huenicorn
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The output is a standalone executable called "huenicorn".
When running Huenicorn, make sure that the "webroot" directory is in the cwd (current working directory).

### Executing program

* Run the executable named "huenicorn" in the way you prefer (Terminal if you want some text feedback)
* Open your favorite web browser at [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)
Browser will spawn automatically for the initial setup and as long as no light profile has been saved
(Service port can be edited in configuration. Default is 8080)

#### Initial setup

When executed for the first time, Huenicorn spawns the setup page in your favorite browser. It consists of a step-by-step wizard to locate your Hue bridge on the network and register an user on it.

Upon setup proper setup termination, Huenicorn will resume in its ordinary execution workflow.

The webpage can then be refreshed to reach the Light Manager interface.

#### Ordinary execution worflow

At startup, Huenicorn will look for a saved profile and start its color streaming execution.

If you want to assign lights to some portions of your screen, open the web interface and drag'n'drop the available lights from the left list to the right one.

When a synced light is selected in the list, its portion of allocated screen can be adjusted in the screen partitioning section.

Once you are satisfied with the layout, you can save it as a profile and it will be automatically reloaded for further executions.

As long as no profile has been saved, light management interface will spawn automatically at startup.

### Configuration files

The configuration files can be found in your home directory at ~/.config/huenicorn/
config.json contains the bridge-related configuration.
profile.json contains the saved channels geometry for an enteraintment configuration.

The data structure of these files is JSON.

#### config.json

* **Channels**: (Array) List of entertainment configuration channels
  * **active**: (Boolean) whether the channel is active or not
  * **channelId**: (Unsigned) Index of the channel in the entertainment configuration
  * **devices**: (Object) List of devices for the channel

      * **x**: (Float) x coordinate
      * **y**: (Float) y coordinate
* **entertainmentConfigurationId**: (String) UUID of the related entertainment configuration

#### Shutting down

Huenicorn can be shut down through the web interface or by sending a termination signal.
